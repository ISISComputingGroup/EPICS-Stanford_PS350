This document contains some brief instructions detailing how to run this system for a simple demo of one of the LabVIEW drivers written by staff at ISIS that has been converted for use as an EPICS server. For more information on this process, how it was achieved, the drawbacks, issues etc. please see the appropriate document referenced in the Suport Documents folder.

****IMPORTANT!!!****
You have to run this in LabVIEW 2011 32-bit with the DSC module installed, and other software configuration and the driver will not run


Hardware setup
This is a driver for a Eurotherm, however, it has been altered for testing to use a dummy signal generated mathematically. If a eurotherm is available a few changes need to be undertaken in order to facilitate this.
Change 1 - Open the Eurotherm - Project > My Computer > DEMO > Eurotherm - VISA Serial - Command.vi, go to the block diagram and enable the currently disabled frame.
Change 2 - Run the setup dialog and enter the data as appropriate for the connected eurotherm


Accessing the PVs
To run the Eurotherm EPICS driver, open Eurotherm - Project > My Computer > DEMO > Eurotherm - Front Panel - Simple x 2.vi and click on the run arrow.
To get to the Process Variables that have been set up you need to use the format:

host:euros2:xx

host should be substituted with the name of the host, in the case of LabVIEW always the name of the host computer.
euros2 is constant for this driver
xx is replacable with a value relating to the front panel items as follows:

T1	Temperature of Controller 1
T2	Temperature of Controller 2
S1	Setpoint of Controller 1
S2	Setpoint of Controller 2
R1	Required Setpoint of Controller 1
R2	Required Setpoint of Controller 2
G1	Set Button of Controller 1
G2	Set Button of Controller 2

The T, S and R values are all numeric. The two G values are Boolean, 0=False, 1=True.
