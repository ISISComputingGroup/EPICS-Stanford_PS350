Start MSVC console

Set the paths and env vars (adjust as appropriate):

    set EPICS_HOST_ARCH=win32-x86
    set EPICS_BASE=C:\EPICS\base\
    set EPICS_TOP=%EPICS_BASE%
    set EPICS_BIN=%EPICS_BASE%\bin\%EPICS_HOST_ARCH%
    set EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST=127.0.0.1
    set EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST=NO
    set PATH=%EPICS_BIN%;%PATH%

    set EPICSQT=C:\EPICS_Qt_Framework\epicsqt\
    set QCAQTDIR=C:\QtSDK\
    set QCAFRAMEWORK=%EPICSQT%\ca_framework
    set PATH=%QCAQTDIR%\Desktop\Qt\4.8.1\msvc2010\bin;%PATH%
    set PATH=%QCAQTDIR%\QtCreator\bin;%PATH%

Building and installing
--------------------

From the epicsqt directory:

qmake epicsqt.pro
nmake

Copy qwt_designer_plugin.dll and lib to the Qt designer plugins directory (something like C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.8.1\msvc2010\plugins\designer\).
Copy the other qwt dlls to the Qt bin folder (something like C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.8.1\msvc2010\bin\)
Starting the Qt designer found in the Qt bin folder should automatically load the qwt plugins.

Copy the QCaPlugin.dll and lib to the Qt designer plugins directory.
Copy the ca.dll and Com.dll (from EPICS) to the Qt bin folder (or set up the paths correctly!)
Starting the Qt designer found in the Qt bin folder should automatically load the qwt plugins.
